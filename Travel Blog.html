<h2>San Francisco, California</h2> 
<p>
One of the travels that I have experienced would be California. During our stay at California, my family and I visited both Sacremento and San Francisco. When we visited San Francisco, we
went to Alcatraz, Piers, and Tours. When we visited Sacremento we went to our friends house to meet up.

<h3>Other Travels</h3>

<p>
Along with California, I have also been to Cancun (A tropical-hot place) and India. At Cancun, I was able to stay at a resort. Additionally, my family and I were able to go on many tours. India was fun as well, because I was able to play with many friends, and meet up with lots of family. <hr>
